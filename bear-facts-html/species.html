            <h3>North American Black Bear</h3>
            <img src="https://placebear.com/g/200/100">
            <p>The North American Black Bear is the most common bear in North America ranging from the State of Florida
                north, into Canada and north to Alaska. The black and brown color phase of the black bear is common. The
                white color phase is more rare occurring in north western British Columbia, Canada. The black bear is
                omnivorous. Their diet is mostly vegetable matter.

            <h3>Brown Bear</h3>
            <img src="https://placebear.com/g/120/120">
            <p>The Brown Bear can be found in Alaska, western Canada, and parts of Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
                Small individual populations are scattered throughout parts of Europe and Asia. Russia has a healthy
                population of brown bears currently. Brown bears range in color from almost black, brown to very light
                brown or blonde.

            <h3>Polar Bear</h3>
            <img src="https://placebear.com/g/200/150">
            <p>Polar bears are among the largest bears in the world. Adult males may reach 800 kilograms (kg) or 1760
                pounds (lbs). In Ontario, the largest male bear recorded from “live capture” research studies weighed
                654 kg (1439 lbs). The average weight of male polar bears in Ontario is about 500 kg (1100 lbs). Adult
                female bears are smaller and average around 300 kg (660 lbs); their peak weights do not usually exceed
                400 kg (880 lbs)

            <h3>Panda Bear</h3>
            <img src="https://placebear.com/g/300/100">
            <p>The giant panda is a rare, endangered and elusive bear. Science used to believe that the giant panda was
                a member of the raccoon family. With DNA analyses science proved itself wrong. The giant panda and the
                red panda are not related. Giant pandas are famous for their love of bamboo, a diet so nutritionally
                poor that the pandas have to consume up to 20kg each day.
